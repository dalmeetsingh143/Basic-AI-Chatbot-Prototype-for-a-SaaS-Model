# Basic-AI-Chatbot-Prototype-for-a-SaaS-Model
In a SaaS framework, this project successfully created a basic AI chatbot prototype for an e- commerce helpdesk, showcasing important features like greeting users and responding to frequently asked questions. The chatbot was implemented as a web application with a contemporary HTML interface, and it accessed FAQs contained in a JSON file using Python, Flask, and spaCy for natural language processing. It describes future improvements for SaaS alignment, such as multi-tenancy, scalability, subscription management, and secure authentication, even though the current implementation satisfies the fundamental requirements. Through the integration of these components, the project creates a strong basis for a multi-tenant, scalable, and user-friendly SaaS-based chatbot solution that will improve e-commerce customer service.
